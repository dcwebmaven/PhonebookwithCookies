# PhonebookwithCookies
This AJAX project is a phonebook with Google Maps API and cookies to track most recent user searches.

The objective/specs for this project are as follows:

Create an HTML document that uses AJAX and a phonebook that is stored as an XML document. 
For this project your phonebook should have at least five entries. 
The HTML document should store the two most recent names searched as a cookie and it should display these names on the webpage as clickable links. 
Upon clicking the link, the value of the search text field should be set equal to the name in the link. 
This will allow your users to simply click the Search Phonebook button to display the information for a particular person.
